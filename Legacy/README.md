## Some quick links to get you started
- Watch the step by step build videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/makeyourpet).<br>
- For build questions and to connect with the community join my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vb8YWMfBuk).<br>
- A [wiring diagram](/wiring-diagram-servo2040.png) that you may find useful.<br>
- A fan-made [parts list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jLi3IdmLERsBDhjaqHxFGQgZul_3uq9oj55M1rFG8mY/edit#gid=0). Also another fan-made [parts list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y--z7EeejWcb-8ooPaIFn3Hulu9dJOcoKyGoxGq8KI8/edit?usp=drivesdk). And here is a [third one](https://github.com/LonelyGhost6/Public/blob/main/part-list.pdf). These are not meant to be a complete list of EVERYTHING that you need, but they cover most of the important and pricier stuff.<br>
- If you decide to use the Servo2040 board (highly recommended), find the [firmware](https://github.com/EddieCarrera/chica-servo2040-simpleDriver/releases/download/v0.0.1/chica-servo2040_release.uf2) and the [instructions on how to flash it](https://github.com/EddieCarrera/chica-servo2040-simpleDriver#loading-the-firmware-image) from Eddie's repository.<br>

## About the STL files in this repository
Some of the parts have multiple versions with slight differences. But all of them are compatible and should work.  
Make sure to check all of them to pick the one that works for you before committing to the print.  
I use the latest version of each part in my own hexapod, which is the one with the higher number at the end of its name.

## Compatible fan-made 3D printable parts
Check out [this](https://github.com/almelnz2005/hexapod) repository which contains modified (but compatible) versions of the original parts which uses metal horns, M3 screws and seperated components to make the parts more 3D printer friendly. This is especially helpful if you are printing with material other than PLA and have issues with supports or shrinking.
